- I'm interested in enhancing books with A.I., and more broadly, making language more sensory.
- I'm looking to collaborate on creating a visual-musical-audiobook experience, customisable to the user's unique blend of tastes in music, art, and books.
- My initial inspiration for this idea was a perpetual switch between Audible and Spotify on commutes.
- I think this idea can be applied to make literature more accessible and entertaining to everyone, whether it's a children's storybook or a quantum mechanics textbook.
- Sensescribe.com currently serves as a proof of concept prototype, and I'm open sourcing it to network with potential users and contributors to gather feedback and discuss the next steps.
