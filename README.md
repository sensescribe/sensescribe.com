- Hi, I'm Barney, founder of @sensescribe
- I'm interested in enhancing books with A.I., and more broadly, making language more sensory.
- I'm currently learning everything! I have very little experience in developing software and deploying web apps.
- All I have is an obsession with this idea, which combined with the intelligence of ChatGPT, still gets stuff done.
- I'm looking to collaborate on creating a visual-musical-audiobook experience, customisable to the user's unique blend of tastes in music, art, and books.
- My inspiration for this idea was a perpetual switch between Audible and Spotify on commutes.
- Also, I'm dyslexic and never read a book before Audible, but now I've read hundreds, both fiction and non-fiction.
- I really think this idea can be applied to make literature more accessible and entertaining to everyone, whether it's a children's storybook or a quantum mechanics textbook.
- Sensescribe.com currently serves as a proof of concept prototype, and I'm open sourcing it to network with potential users and contributors to gather feedback and discuss the next steps.
